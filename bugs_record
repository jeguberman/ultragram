bug: images reducer. newState = oldState; new state was taking on action? Solution was to merge oldstate with empty object, which I should have done in the first place, but I couldn't tell you why newState copied action?

bug: merge is not a function in images_reducer.
solution: used
import {merge} from 'lodash/merge'
 but wanted
 import merge from 'lodash/merge'

 still didn't fix solution. checked lodash docs. merge certainly exists, so ran npm install lodash. must have forgotten initially
***********************
 not technically a bug, but data doesn't exist where I think it should
 WHAT I THINK SHOULD HAPPEN:
 the image show container, before rendering, ought to fetch the image information and add it to store.state. Because image components props include this slice of state, the update should trigger a rerender

 but even as I type it, that's silly. semantically it can't trigger a rerender because we haven't rendered, but more technically, it can't trigger a rerender because nothing is changing props
