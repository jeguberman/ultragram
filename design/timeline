      Galactus, if you're just drowning in extra time, which you won't be.
    7 images per user
      Thanos' images are normal
      Dr. Doom's images are culture festivals and inventions
      Mr. Shadow's images are cosmic images (nebulae, star clusters, galaxies, jovian moons, this one is too easy to waste time on)
      Cthulu's images are non euclidean images, MC Escher, optical illusions, magic eyes.

      Nobody likes Dr Doom's images
      try to put at least 5 likes across 2-3 images per user, except for dr. doom
        it this proves burdensome, just set some randos. don't spend more than 45 minutes seeding likes

      Galactus Supports Thanos' dreams on one of thanos' pictures.
      Dr. Doom wants to know how to tell if other people can see his images.
      If you can make it happen in less than 10 minutes, cthulu's text should be copied from a binary file.
      Like a few comments here and there. Dr. doom doesn't like anybody's stuff except his own. Nobody likes dr. doom.
