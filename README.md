TODO
* redo component heiarchies and schema if you have a chance, they do not reflect the assignment

* clean up MVP list, make sure it consists of reasonable goals. You don't need a login from facebook button (do you?)

* Clean up your schema, find out how to create a table in md documents, good god man, you could have done nothing to the same effect.

* conceptualize seeds, you'll need pictures, you don't want to rush around at the eleventh hour downloading pictures.
