# README

A clone of instagram created as a full stack project for App Academy. I am not affiliated with instagram or facebook. This is intended to be educational. Also it's specifically for earth-shattering supervillains. ULTRAGRAM


I am using this space for a todo list. This todo list is not for future tasks, which are outlined in the homeworks, but documents which I came to realize should be done differently, after the fact.

Because this is a learning process, many documents will have more conflicts than usual. The most recently added design doc (usually from a homework) shall be considered "correct" unless otherwise stated. That document is [state & state_sample]

TODO
* redo component heiarchies and schema if you have a chance, they do not reflect . HIGH PRIORITY

* clean up MVP list, make sure it consists of reasonable goals. You don't need a login from facebook button (do you?)

* Clean up your schema, find out how to create a table in md documents, good god man, you could have done nothing to the same effect.

* conceptualize seeds, you'll need pictures, you don't want to rush around at the eleventh hour downloading pictures.
